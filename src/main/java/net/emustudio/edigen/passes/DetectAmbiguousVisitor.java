/**
 * <p>
 * A visitor which checks for ambiguous variants.
 * This visitor is not a transformation; the tree is left unmodified. It
 * must be applied after the grouping transformation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Ambiguity is dangerous, because it can cause unintended behavior not discovered until the generated decoder is run.
 * There are two types of ambiguity: path ambiguity and variant ambiguity.
 * </p>
 *
 * <strong>Path ambiguity</strong>
 * <p>
 * Path ambiguity means that for some rule and input, decoder is not able to decide which execution path to choose
 * without reading more input, even if the deep contains solution. The reason is that Decoder is simple state machine
 * which decides only based on the current state and input. It means that the current implementation of decoder doesn't
 * support look-aheads.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Effect of path ambiguity is that only the first found path would be executed by decoder, and all other ambiguous paths
 * would be ignored forever. Therefore this smells of unintended behavior.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Let N be a rule node or a Pattern node which is an indirect child of the rule. Then, two variants of the rule have
 * ambiguous path if:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>N has two direct children: masks M1 and M2</li>
 *     <li>M1 has direct child pattern P1</li>
 *     <li>M2 has direct child pattern P2</li>
 *     <li><code>M1 &amp; M2 &amp; P1 = M1 &amp; M2 &amp; P2</code></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Example of path ambiguity:
 * <pre>
 *     Rule
 *       Mask (111)
 *         Pattern (101)
 *       Mask (101)
 *         Pattern (101)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <strong>Variant ambiguity</strong>
 * Variant ambiguity means that one pattern has more than one child variant.
